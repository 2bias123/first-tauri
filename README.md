# tGraph
Welcome to the Tauri Graph Algorithm Playground! This is a simple application that allows you to draw weighted graphs and run graph algorithms on them. Currently, the only algorithm available is Dijkstra's algorithm, but stay tuned as more algorithms are on the way!

## Usage
### Drawing a Graph
* To draw a graph, simply click on the canvas to create nodes.
* To create edges between nodes, click on one node and then another.
* Add the weight of the edge in the form that shows up

### Running Dijkstra's Algorithm
* To run Dijkstra's algorithm on the graph, click the "Run Dijkstra" button.
* Add the start node and end node in the form that shows up.
* The algorithm will compute the shortest paths from a selected source node to all other nodes and display the results on the graph.

### Clearing the Graph
* To clear the current graph and start fresh, click the "Clear Graph" button.
